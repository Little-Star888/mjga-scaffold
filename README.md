[MJGA](https://www.mjga.cc) is a modern Java web scaffold built based on the following principles:

* Modern technology stack: The scaffold is designed to be international and keeps up with the trends in the open-source community.
* Lightweight: Select the components and modules you prefer on the website with a lightweight footprint.
* Comprehensive testing: Rigorous unit tests designed from the ground up and executed in isolated environments.
* Meticulous coding: Every variable, function, module, and component follows best practices.
* Not-all-in-one: MJGA maintains its boundaries to adapt to both present and future needs.
