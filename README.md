[MJGA](https://www.mjga.cc) is a modern Java Web scaffolding designed with cloud-native concepts in mind. It offers the
following features:

- Containerized applications
- Modular components
- Highly regarded unit tests

## Technology Stack ü•ù

![option.png](asset/option_en.png)

### Containerization and Cloud-Native üçã

1. Manage the entire lifecycle and configuration of the application via `docker-compose.yml`.
2. Customize all configurations through the `.env` file.
3. Deliver the entire application and its ecosystem components via `docker-compose.yml`.

### Out-of-the-Box üçå

1. Integrates common basic business functions such as authentication, permission management, and cache abstraction.
2. Code Check&Format, CI/CD Plugin, Docker Integration are all ready to use out-of-the-box.
3. Comprehensive, design-driven, and environment-isolated unit tests.

### Modernization üçí

1. Modern: Technology choices follow the trends of the open-source community.
2. Configurable: Supports component selection on the web.
3. Best Practices: Every variable, function, module, and component is designed with best practices in mind.
4. Focus on Boundaries: Stays within its functional boundaries, not aiming to be a "Not All In One" solution.

## Component Selection üçá

More components are under development...

## Quick Start üçâ

**Confirm Environment Variables and Execution Permissions**

```shell
# confirm .env and make sure process can use it
vim ${projectRoot}/.env
# confirm gradlew executable (unix-like OS)
chmod 755 ${projectRoot}/gradlew
```

**[Install Docker and Start Containers](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)**

```shell
cd ${projectRoot}
docker compose up -d database
docker compose build web
docker compose up -d web
```

**(Optional) Start Locally**

```shell
# confirm .env and gradle.properties make sure process can use it
vim ${projectRoot}/.env
vim ${projectRoot}/gradle.properties
docker compose up -d database
./gradlew jooqCodegen
${projectRoot}/gradlew bootRun
```

## Common Tools ü•ú

**Compile the Project and Generate Table Mapping Objects and Data Access Layer Based on Database Schema**

```shell
# confirm .env and make sure process can use it
vim ${projectRoot}/.env
# generate schema mapping codes
./gradlew jooqCodegen
# output ->
# projectRootDir/build/generated-sources
# ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ org.jooq.generated
#    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ tables # table mapping
#       ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ daos # Data Access Layer
#       ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ pojos # mapping dto
#       ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ records # jooq query record

```

**Global Code Formatting**

```shell
./gradlew spotlessApply
```

**Global Code Inspection**

```shell
# confirm .env and make sure process can use it
vim ${projectRoot}/.env
./gradlew pmdMain
```

**Unit Testing**

```shell
# confirm .env and make sure process can use it
vim ${projectRoot}/.env
# will automatically generate jacocoTestReport
./gradlew test
```
